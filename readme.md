##Important Notes
### Emmisions Warranty
 Summary: Converters have a Emmisions Waranty - 15 Years - 150,000 miles. 

The catalytic converter is covered by the vehicle's emissions warranty, which extends beyond the manufacturer's factory warranty.  Along with other emission control devices, federal law requires manufacturers to replace a defective converter for up to 15 years or 150,000 miles. Because this coverage varies by state and vehicle type, refer to your owner’s manual for your warranty information.

### Failure is often caused by O2 sensors, consider replacing.
 Summary: In the majority of catalytic converters, the O2 sensors failure leads to catalytic converter failure..
